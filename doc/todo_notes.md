# Issues (and required features)

- [ ] #i2: make inference work from `xaiev --inference simple_cnn_1_1`
- [x] #i1: add `xaiev --bootstrap` (to create .env file in current working directory)
    - motivation: this simplifies installing from pypi

# Ideas

- `xaiev --bootstrap /path/to/data/dir` would be nice (no need to manually edit the .env file after creation)
